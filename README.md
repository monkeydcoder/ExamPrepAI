## Applications

The project consists of two main applications:

1. **EduMind AI Platform** - An AI-powered exam preparation platform
2. **EduMind AI Documentation** - A documentation website for the platform

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v16 or higher
- Ollama for running AI models locally (llama3.1 and llama3.2)
- Git (for version control)

## Quick Start

The easiest way to run all components is using the provided scripts:

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Start all components (backend, frontend, and documentation)
./scripts/start-all.sh
```

This will start:
- Backend on http://localhost:3001
- Frontend on http://localhost:5173
- Documentation on http://localhost:8080

## Running Individual Components

### 1. Running the Main EduMind AI Platform

#### Start the Backend:

```bash
# Using script
./scripts/start-backend.sh

# Or manually
cd app/backend
npm install
PORT=3001 node server.js
```

The backend server will run on http://localhost:3001

#### Start the Frontend:

```bash
# Using script
./scripts/start-frontend.sh

# Or manually
cd app/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will run on http://localhost:5173

### 2. Running the Documentation Website

```bash
# Using script
./scripts/start-docs.sh

# Or manually
cd docs
npm install
npm run dev
```

The documentation website will run on http://localhost:8080
